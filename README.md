About

Bank Management System: A Core Java project designed to streamline banking operations. Features include account management, transaction tracking, and secure data storage using MySQL. Leveraging JDBC for smooth database interactions.

In this project series, we'll build a Bank Management System and ATM Simulator using Core Java (Swing & AWT) and MySQL for database management. The system will mimic a typical ATM, offering functionalities such as depositing, withdrawing, opening bank accounts, generating mini statements, changing PINs, and more. This project provides a comprehensive understanding of building and managing a banking application using Java technologies and SQL-based databases.
